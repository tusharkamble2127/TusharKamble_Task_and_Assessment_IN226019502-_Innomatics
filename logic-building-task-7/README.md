# Feb Internship – Task 7: Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)
## Overview

This repository contains solutions for Task 7: OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming) as part of the February 2026 Data Science Internship.

The objective of this task is to apply object-oriented concepts such as classes, constructors, attributes, and methods to build real-world system simulations.

## Problems Implemented

1.Smart Light Controller

2.Employee ID Card System

3.Mobile Contact Record

4.Product Price Tag Generator

5.Movie Rating Display System

6.Delivery Address Manager

Each problem demonstrates practical implementation of OOPS concepts in real-world scenarios like smart homes, HR systems, retail billing, and logistics platforms.

## Key Concepts Applied

Class and Object Creation

Constructors (__init__)

Instance Variables

Method Definitions

Real-world System Modeling

Structured and Modular Code

## Learning Outcome

This task strengthened my understanding of object-oriented programming and improved my ability to design modular, reusable, and real-world system-based Python programs.
